# CS 100 2017F Homework 05

## Problem 1

- Write a function named `hasFinalLetter` that takes two parameters:
    
    - `strList`, a list of non-empty strings
    - `letters`, a string of upper and/or lower case letters
- The function `hasFinalLetter` should create and return a list of all the strings in `strList` that end with a letter in `letters`.
    
    - Create three test cases, each consisting of a list of non-empty strings and a string of upper and/or lower case letters, for your function in Problem 1a. One of these tests should return the empty list. For each test case write two assignment statements and a function call that pass the test arguments to your function.

## Problem 2

Write a function named `isDivisible` that takes two parameters:
    
    - `maxInt`, an integer
    - `twoInts`, a tuple of two integers
    

The function `isDivisible` should create and return a list of all the int’s in the range from 0 to `maxInt` (not including `maxInt`) that are divisible by both int’s in `twoInts`.
    
    - Create three test cases, each consisting of a value for maxInt and a value for twoInts, for your function in Problem 2a. One of these tests should return the empty list. For each test case write two assignment statements and a function call that pass the test arguments to your function
