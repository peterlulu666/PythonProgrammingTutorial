# CS 100 2017F Homework 01
**Due**: at the beginning of the **third class** of the semester. 
**Do** all of the items below and **submit** a text file created in the IDLE editor with the extension ‘.py’ via Moodle. If you run into a problem, post to Moodle describing where you ran into trouble or email your instructor or classroom assistant, or ask your question during office hours. If you know the answer to someone’s question on Moodle, post a response. You get course credit for asking and answering questions in Moodle.

1. Read Chapter 10 (Lists) in the textbook. You may skip the sections Map, Filter and Reduce; and List Arguments. Read the first two sections of Chapter 11 (Tuples): Tuples Are Immutable and Tuple Assignment.
2. This question practices the use of a list method. Assign to the variable grades a list of 10 letter grades from among 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'F'. For example,

grades = ['A', 'F', 'C', 'F', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'A', 'B']

Write a Python expression that creates a list named frequency, in which the elements are the number of times each of the letters A, B, C, D and F appear in grades. For example, for the above value of grades, the following would be correct output.

frequency = [4, 2, 2, 0, 2]

Your expression must give the correct values for any list of grades, not just the one in your list. Hint: use the list method count.

3. This question practices list membership, list indexes and list slices.

    A. Write a Python statement that creates a list named dog_breeds that contains the elements 'collie', 'sheepdog', 'Chow', and 'Chihuahua'.
    
    B. Write a Python statement that uses list slicing to create a list herding_dogs that is made up of the first two elements of dog_breeds.
    
    C. Write a Python statement that uses list indexing to create a list tiny_dogs that is made up of the last element of dog_breeds.
    
    D. Write a Python statement that tests whether 'Persian' is in the list dog_breeds and prints either True or False depending on the answer.
