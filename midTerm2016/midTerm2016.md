## Question 13

Write a function named getDate. The function getDate takes one parameter:
- message, a string

In addition to the parameter message, the function getDate should prompt the user for two items of input: first the month, then the day.

The function getDate should produce two kinds of output. It should
- print out the month, day and message, separated by spaces
- return a string consisting of the month and day, separated by a space 

For example, the following would be correct input and output:

```shell script
>>> today = getDate('is a great day!')
What month is it? February
What day is it? 15
February 15 is a great day!
>>> print(today)
February 15
```
